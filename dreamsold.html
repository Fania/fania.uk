							<h3>30 June 14</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I was in the cinema and many seats had reservations in the form blow up animals covering the reserved seats. My aunt Tamara was there "coordinating" something and asking me to check the dangers of tunnels on my phone. Suddenly I was in a hut in a valley with strong strong sandy winds blowing. I'm thinking this must be one of the dangers of tunnels. I was holding a massive old tome (which was my phone) to cover myself from the sand. I thought it would give the book charm when it's covered in sand. We then had coffee made in a large chemistry set. The windows of the hut were broken.</p>

							<h3><span title="Started co-beneldopa meds again.">29 June 14<span></h3>
						</header>
						<p>In wheelchair at very large shopping centre. Looking for marzipan, a bikini and a small sewing kit to fix a broken sleeve of the top I was wearing.</p>

							<h3>28 June 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Amusement park. Alena there. A person like Markus 2 there. Me photographing the scenery and sky and people. Shitty old camera. Rollercoaster with Markus. Over a lake. On the way out at the edge of a forest we queue for returning keys or something and a massive empty cage opens. We wonder if they keep humans in that cage sometimes.</p>
					</div>

							<h3>17 June 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Old home in BB with family. I was throwing up a lot. First my dad, then my mum then Alena then Jannie all argued with me. My mum also argued with Alena in between. I was trying to clean dishes but kept throwing up into the sink or on the dishes or the floor or anywhere. People kept piling laundry in the kitchen so I started arguing about me wanting to do the dishes first. At one point I threw up on my laptop and it went inside it so I put it in my old room I once shared with Alena. Some stuff they were arguing to me about: cloth, money. I threw up little fish at one point (we were swimming in a lake full of plants earlier). I opened the postbox at one point too and all letters had been blatantly opened. At one point also one of my mums friends walked in a started telling her that her next door neighbour is actually somebody she knows from work for years.</p>

							<h3>15 June 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>River waterskiing in half circle, attached by rope. Alena there. River gigantic cudgel bridg. Eva giant coming up the river. I was with bad girl who could transform into giant and had glowing eyes. She took me in her hand. Walking along a road past characters next to a guy. Anime intro like. Ended up at the end of the world jumping onto fragments over emptyness. Pub on river with mum and somebody else. Looking for veggy food. Owner complained about meat eater customers who complain about sittings next to veggies. I had a card from Benni. Wow card? Times written on it. Price tag on the front. I oiled it but ran out. Mum rubbed the card on her chest and price tag came off leaving a mark.</p>

							<h3>?? June 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Game? With family. Collect treasure boxes - they contained jade hair ornaments etc. Half virtual reality half real. Very large world. I had a kitchen sponge thing as weapon and I was killing spiders. The spiders crawled onto my hand though. Corinna - two record players. One was reversed- from middle to outside</p>
					</div>

							<h3>07 June 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Yet another dream about moving into a new (really dirty and run down brick-) house with my family and me in my new room. Then suddenly I was walking outside with some noname people and there was war for some reason and somebody gave me a newborn baby through a tiny window and we walked away. The baby was naked and I tried to keep it warm by wrapping it to my chest somehow with my clothes.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="entry">

							<h3>14 May 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I had a 'nightmare' about not being able to walk again. My legs just weren't strong enough and I collapsed and tried to crawl but didn't work. For some reason I was in my old old school building.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="entry">
						<header>
							<h3>13 April 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Marathon? or festival with tents and mud and wellies and shorts. Lots of bright green pens stuck in the ground around the fence or near the path with a few odd brown pens. Old friends from the area I grew up (Silke, Bernd, Marijke) swimming pool. River I jumped in. Storm. Walking along a motorway to a supermarket. Looking for shorts/short leggings to buy (asda quality awesomeness for ï¿¡3). Buying beer for Migi who was waiting in the staircase and who I met randomly. Alena was there trying on clothes with me. Hills. A stage with incredibly weird mini-short-displays of weird stage deco and a projection of sorts. Supposedly meant to be arty but looked like a cheap kindergarten production. Tomoyuki was there and we talked about research and work. Silke kept interrupting me talking about her elusive dad.</p>

							<h3>06 April 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I walked into the classroom at school. (My old school before Karlsruhe) I sat down on my seat and then realised that I was sitting on my neighbours seat. So I got up and looked around and my chair was some place else. Later on in the next break I approached her (the girl in whose chair I sat first) and said "Sorry I sat in your chair. In the universe I come from, I used to sit right next to you here and we were friends. But in this universe it seems I'm sitting over there".</p>
					</div>
					<div class="entry">
						<header>
							<h3>?? April 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Me and three girlfriends (2 from my old school and 1 from the one in Karlsruhe - all of them not actually friends of mine, just some girls I knew from then) were on a strange sort of Indiana Jones type trip somewhere with only one kinda path ahead and lots and lots of traps. The kind of thing Indy would encounter right before finding the treasure. No idea what we were doing. It felt like we didn't want to be there, so I don't think we were treasure hunting. More like somebody had dropped us into this nightmare for no reason. I was struggling a lot all the time. Not keeping up, not being flexible enough, not strong enough... Two of the other girls had bugs in their ears. They sort of tried to help me along but it was hard and I knew they would leave me behind if necessary.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="entry">
						<header>
							<h3>13 March 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Had a weird long dream, most of which is forgotten now. It included my first love and some sort of disaster, running around trying to find survivors, we were sort of trapped in a building. He was just there watching me like he used to. We never even kissed (not in dreams and not in real life) but were kinda in love with each other for a few years (maybe when I was 13-16?).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="entry">
						<header>
							<h3>28 February 2014</h3>
						</header>
						<p>There was hair! Something about hair. Maybe I cut mine? But it was curly? Not sure. The other odd bit was that I was kissing one of my school mates (Mulski) a lot. Absolutely no idea why he popped into my dreams. I haven't spoken to him or seen him for years. I have kissed him before (as part of Migi's thing of passing me around his friends) but hmmmmm, it's just weird. Also, he used to shave his hair really short, so no connection to the hair element of the dream there....</p>
