My mum also argued with Alena in between. \nI was trying to clean dishes but kept throwing up into the sink or on the dishes or the floor or anywhere. People kept piling laundry in the kitchen so I started arguing about me wanting to do the dishes first. At one point I threw up on my laptop and it went inside it so I put it in my old room I once shared with Alena. Some stuff they were arguing to me about: cloth, money. I threw up little fish at one point (we were swimming in a lake full of plants earlier). I opened the postbox at one point too and all letters had been blatantly opened. At one point also one of my mums friends walked in a started telling her that her next door neighbour is actually somebody she knows from work for years. ",

The following day we kept going about our business as if nothing had happened. We were in school and some new people joined and seemed to follow us. Somehow I knew they knew it was Migi. The police had also started investigating. I was scared and felt guilty for not preventing it even though I kinda knew about the bomb. I thought Migi should talk to the police and explain he didn't know what was in the bag. \n\nMe and school mates from Karlsruhe were on a trip to some ruined temple in a strange country. Jannie and Leigh were there too. There were stairs everywhere and we were very high up in mountains. Leigh and me ran up some stairs to see the view. I was slightly concerned about my breathing. A group of us then ran even further up where there was some sort of round plateau. It was very grassy. I was taking pictures of the scenery and the people. Gabi too. At times I saw the dream through his lense, so saw myself standing and taking pictures. At one point I saw someone flat on the ground and I went to take a photo thinking it was Gabi but it was Laura. We ended up talking about culture and Indian weddings and Jannie. We walked towards a kitchen (which had appeared out of nowhere sort of underground) which had a very narrow entrance. ",

It sort if felt like everyone around me knew and judged me for it as it's obviously my fault. It felt horrible.  My 'boyfriend' wasn't in the dream but I knew I had just spent the day with him. I wondered why he hadn't told me about A's death. ",

  "text" : "Romy was trying to kill me. She came looking through kitchen window naked and kept cursing me. When she saw me she projected something on me like a laser pointer. Then she had a gun and walked around the house from window to window to find me. She also had a shot gut and shot into the side of the building. It was the old house in BB. My family was there. She accused me of arrogance and I was completely clueless about why she attacked me. Alena had called the police. Jannie and Celine were trying to hide me in their room under a pile of pillows but I fled into the bathroom. Romy knocked on the balcony door and my sisters naively opened it asking what she wants from me. Of course she walked in and found me. I kept soothing her, asking her what I've done and why she is so upset and angry and she kept waving the gun insanely. Eventually she gave in and sort of fell asleep in my arms just as the police arrived. They took her away and started collecting evidence and questioned us. I was still in shock and for some reason nobody cared about me. Alena was excited about going to the police to give a statement and dressed up ridiculously and everybody was really proud of her. I wanted to go as well, after all I was the victim of this attack but everyone seemed a bit annoyed telling me to rush to get changed or questioning my ability to talk in my current state. I felt scared and alone. ",

A boat takes us the last bit of the way. There is a hole in the sea into which the boat has to swim down. I'm scared for our lives and wonder how this is even possible. The hotel is right at the edge of the waterwall. It's crowded and looks old and dirty. We go into my parents room. It's old but very large. Has two showers. One window goes right to the water wall but we are on the top edge. Waves mean that sometimes the window is covered by water and sometimes not. I open it but then water comes in and I try to close it but struggle. Eventually Jannie helps me. My mum is on the bed. She tells me to go over some paperwork which i spread out on the floor. It's old stuff for my old jobs or places I had applied to or was interested in. I was confused and asked why the hell she would take all this on a remote island holiday. There is stuff from Mercedes in there but also BMW. I wonder in my dream if I worked there too at some point. \nWe climb out of another window that leads to the beach and then realise that we don't remember which window is ours. My parents climb back into random windows. People look out and see me standing confused and embarrassed. We find the right room. Suddenly we explore more inside. There is another room attached without a door. There are three straight golden chains on the floor. They have spearheads at one end and rings at the other. I'm confused. We then realise this room leads to the next apartment occupied by a Muslim family. I realise the chains are meant to show where east is etc. They discuss who this rooms belongs to. There is a door to their rooms but none to ours so in my head I think 'well, it's obviously ours' but am too polite to say it and this family seems convinced it's theirs. I keep thinking we should check out the other room we have booked. I think it was only Jannie and me on this holiday. ",

I sit in the car for a while but then come out and wait with Nenne and a woman and two children. They speak Turkish with Nenne. Eventually the men come back with a gift. It's a man who will play Nennes dead fathers corpse. Suddenly it seems more like Nenne is Migi - Cuban. I point out that they have the same skin.

Holding on to a strap, turns out that was attached to the hood of a guy sitting next to me. Bus slides on ice, I hold on to the outside of the bus and consider jumping off before it crashes. The bus crashes into a lake and sinks. I make it out and start swimming. There are people trying to hold onto ice sheets to climb out of the lake. Suddenly there are lots of people. TV channels, NUS, local charities etc are trying to gather people to help. Big party with stage next to lake, screens, crowds, music etc. we try to find all hairs from the lake by bringing them to one of the stages. The hairs are swollen, like spaghetti. Eventually we are done. I wonder if it's ok to start digging for my suitcase. I had seen where it is and start clearing it. I get all my clothes out into a pile. I find my old purple phone and wonder if it still works. I call my parents. Just then I see my mum next to the lake talking to someone. I go to her and we get ready to leave. I try to explain what happened. \n\n---\n\nTourist in a town with family. Walking around. Caravan. Trapped inside. Chased around from room to room. ",

Dave with his electric guitar. Guitar is slightly broken. I carry it but then hand it to Dave when Nenne starts asking about it. Nenne is then all over Dave. I point out that Dave is my partner and Nenne is surprised. Suddenly the band leaves to get ready. Staff whisper and Nenne points them to Dave who gets asked to follow the band backstage. No idea why. \n\nMe walking from the pool place in BB to home. Everything has changed. Rubbish trucks speed past me towards to pool\/festival grounds. It's the future. I'm walking through a garage type place and there are police type guys everywhere. I hear them talk about some boy and terrorism is mentioned. I exit the garage and walk towards where my old home would have been. \n\nI walk past a woman near a fence. She is showing a remote to a camera phone thing. It lets her control a massive white limousine. She explains how it's a failed model that was given away because of its flaws.

  "text" : "Swinging house and snake\n\nMoving into a very old and abandoned house with my family. Top floor. Lots of spider webs everywhere. Wondering where my room is going to be. Spending the first night. Putting a few small items next to the mattress. \n\nThe whole house was swinging. Like totally so the top floor touches the side of the ground. Wondering how to prevent that by either putting sticks to hold it up or wires to another building. \n\nThen all of a sudden we are in a camping like village in a forest. The trailer Alena and me are in swings too. But next to a river and I fear we will fall in. I wake the others and try to get them to help secure it somehow. \n\nWe end up getting lost. Near the river. Massive earth openings. Lots of people walking though. Parents show me small snakes to warn of the danger. I’m naked. Then an absolutely gigantic white snake appears. Not scared at first but then the head appears near us and the snake seems interested. We cower and stay still and the snake moves on. We then decide we must turn back and go another way. I peel some poo out of my arse and smear it into a nearby rubbish bin but can’t wash my hands. On the other way back the snake sees us again. This time it’s clear it’s seen something in me and it spits some fluid on me which I try to avoid getting into my eyes. This is where I wake up.",

I stop and hold on to a guy who takes me up. Water is flowing down the ramp. We come up and the loft space is massive and has lots of chairs arranged in a circular fashion towards the center where some ritual has taken place. There are strange markings on the wall, stitched threads, and entry points into which two people are inserting long sticks. They aren’t hostile, but simply get on with their job. It looks magical. Dave appears and explains that there is no better person than this old guy. \n\nI then see Alena and my mum and my other sisters herd a crowd of buffalos and horses over a little river to another field. I wonder why they are clearing it. \n\nThen we all sit in a room with musical instruments and I start plucking some strings. Not nicely, just curious. But Dave immediately starts playing along and some others too and he points to Ben to play the harmonica. \n",

We get ready to leave, Jess\n wants to leave the buggy but I urge her to bring it\\. \nWe walk for a while\\. \n\nThen hotel\\. Tiny room\\. \n\nThen car\\. Jess driving\\. But ditzy\\. She drives off road, we are lucky\\. We get out and gather things to walk the rest\\. Again she wants to leave the buggy but I offer to push it\\. I’m super anxious but don’t want to argue\\. \n\nI keep thinking I have to keep things from blowing up somehow\\. Very nightmarish\\. \n",
