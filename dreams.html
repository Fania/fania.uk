				<h3>08 July 14</h3>
				<p>I was with a group of people entering some sort of <strong>temple</strong>. There was a big entrance hall and I stood right infront of the inner gate looking up at the decorations on the wall above the door. I got a bit dizzy as my <strong>vision morphed</strong> weirdly. A guy in the group noticed me swaying and grabed me and guided me inside. Walking into the inner chamber required you to do certain praying like movements while slowly moving. There were rows of cloth (not carpets) on the ground for people to sit on. I did those movements a few times to pay my respects and then decided it was ok to stop and try to find a good place to sit. There were vendors selling items on the ground on some cloths. One woman rudely tripped over things. It seemed like there were lots of tourists. Eventually the ceremony started. We all lied down and curled up sideways. People were very close to each other so we were basically spooning each other. First to the right and then to the left. Suddenly the guy on my left side (Jack from Lost) started having <strong>seizures and died</strong> in my arms. I cried a lot. The next part of the ceremony suddenly involved everybody sitting in a big circle and a young <strong>living deity</strong> walked around and if it pleased him he spoke to a person or blessed them in some way. He looked at me and started talking about a <strong>baby</strong>, asking me what name I have picked. I said I didn't and he started wailing and crying with me. He then kissed me on the lips over and over as a form of blessing. I kept <strong>crying</strong>. The guy who had helped me earlier seemed very concerned for me but stayed away.</p>
				<p>I was driving around on <strong>motorcycle</strong> with somebody along fields.</p>
				<p>I was in some sort of holiday resort. I was walking along the beach <strong>naked</strong> with a thin piece of cloth. It felt like I was advertising myself, looking for customers. Then I went inside and saw a <strong>steamroom</strong> area downstairs. A goodlooking woman washed me before going in. She disappeared quickly and I looked around. There were several cubicles, each their own steamroom. The doors were slightly seethrough and I could see people inside fucking. Eventually I found the woman and joined her.</p>

				<h3>06 July 14</h3>
				<p>Undis with me in BB. Being dedicated and totally commited to me after one simple kiss. He was lovely but this all was very weird. We were in my old room upstairs (not the cellar room). There was some sort of parade outside. The family car was outisde the garage and neighbours had complained so it needed to be moved. The neighbours opposite were part of some sort of <strong>Fastnacht</strong> society. Undis moved the car but parked it a bit away and I explained he can just park just opposite on the road. My dad was trying to send us to do something (it turned out to be <strong>burning alcohol</strong> he had stored and saved for years).</p>
				<p>There was also some sort of  amusement event going on in our building's cellar. So Undis and me were queuing. We found out the event was about <strong>'cats with remote controls'</strong> to control their mood and behaviour. They were robot cats and looked horrible but people thought they were real with brain implants. Undis put something into my family's flat, he jumped queue a bit to get in (the door was open) and people complained but he then came back and explained what he did. He was really responsible and trustworthy. There were lots of cars and people parading outside.</p>
			</li>

				<h3>03 July 14</h3>
				<p>My mum and sisters were on the road somewhere in a forest. There was a massive <strong>construction site</strong>, it looked like they were digging tunnels. Everything looked very earthy with lots of rocks. Then in the middle of nowhere there was a hotel next to a shop and we stayed there. They had <strong>awesome rooms</strong> - way beyond what we could afford but for some reason we were staying there regardless. Alena and me then moved furniture around, desks and sofa chairs while our mum was sleeping in her room. I then went to call our dad on one of my old phones that was barely working and the reception was crap so I had to go outside. The rooms had several doors one leading directly to the hotel pool and gym with bars and shops.</p>
				<p>Then suddenly I was in a <strong>Porsche</strong> with a guy driving around in BB. He took the small and very very <strong>steep road</strong> up to the church from the market square. It had small steps and eventually got so steep I asked him if he was sure if he can drive up there. He was convinced but we then fell down the road in the car and luckily survived without much harm. He then drove around on the square looking for a road out. Eventually we got near the <strong>lake</strong> and suddenly stood there and the car was gone. There were some school kids "handing in homework" by throwing it into the lake with the teachers standing next to them nodding. One girl jumped into the lake to fetch her work.</p>
				<p>Then I was suddenly on a big farm house on a small hill. The house belonged to the Grosskopf family. They had 8 children (not in real life). I was playing with clay making <strong>small figurines</strong> that looked like feet. I tried to find them to perfect them before we burn them, so I ran through the whole house and garden looking for them. The youngest girls were following me and I kept trying to remember their names.</p>

				<h3>30 June 14</h3>
				<p>I was in the <strong>cinema</strong> and many seats had reservations in the form blow up animals covering the reserved seats. My aunt Tamara was there "coordinating" something and asking me to check the <strong>dangers of tunnels</strong> on my phone. Suddenly I was in a hut in a valley with strong strong <strong>sandy winds</strong> blowing. I'm thinking this must be one of the dangers of tunnels. I was holding a massive old tome (which was my phone) to cover myself from the sand. I thought it would give the book charm when it's covered in sand. We then had coffee made in a large chemistry set. The windows of the hut were broken.</p>

				<h3><span title="Started co-beneldopa meds again.">29 June 14</span></h3>
				<p>In <strong>wheelchair</strong> at very large shopping centre. Looking for marzipan, a bikini and a small sewing kit to fix a broken sleeve of the top I was wearing.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>28 June 2014</h3>
				<p><strong>Amusement park</strong>. Alena there. A person like Markus 2 there. Me photographing the scenery and sky and people. Shitty old camera. Rollercoaster with Markus. Over a lake. On the way out at the edge of a forest we queue for returning keys or something and a massive <strong>empty cage</strong> opens. We wonder if they keep humans in that cage sometimes.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>17 June 2014</h3>
				<p>Old home in BB with family. I was throwing up a lot. First my dad, then my mum then Alena then Jannie all argued with me. My mum also argued with Alena in between. I was trying to clean dishes but kept throwing up into the sink or on the dishes or the floor or anywhere. People kept piling laundry in the kitchen so I started arguing about me wanting to do the dishes first. At one point I threw up on my laptop and it went inside it so I put it in my old room I once shared with Alena. Some stuff they were arguing to me about: cloth, money. I threw up little fish at one point (we were swimming in a lake full of plants earlier). I opened the postbox at one point too and all letters had been blatantly opened. At one point also one of my mums friends walked in a started telling her that her next door neighbour is actually somebody she knows from work for years.</p>

				<h3>15 June 2014</h3>
				<p>River waterskiing in half circle, attached by rope. Alena there.</p>
				<p>River gigantic cudgel bridg. Eva giant coming up the river. I was with bad girl who could transform into giant and had glowing eyes. She took me in her hand.</p>
				<p>Walking along a road past characters next to a guy. Anime intro like. Ended up at the end of the world jumping onto fragments over emptyness.</p>
				<p>Pub on river with mum and somebody else. Looking for veggy food. Owner complained about meat eater customers who complain about sittings next to veggies. I had a card from Benni. Wow card? Times written on it. Price tag on the front. I oiled it but ran out. Mum rubbed the card on her chest and price tag came off leaving a mark.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>?? June 2014</h3>
				<p>Game? With family. Collect treasure boxes - they contained jade hair ornaments etc. Half virtual reality half real. Very large world. I had a kitchen sponge thing as weapon and I was killing spiders. The spiders crawled onto my hand though.<br><br>
				Corinna - two record players. One was reversed- from middle to outside</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>07 June 2014</h3>
				<p>Yet another dream about moving into a new (really dirty and run down brick-) house with my family and me in my new room. Then suddenly I was walking outside with some noname people and there was war for some reason and somebody gave me a newborn baby through a tiny window and we walked away. The baby was naked and I tried to keep it warm by wrapping it to my chest somehow with my clothes.</p>

				<h3>14 May 2014</h3>
				<p>I had a 'nightmare' about not being able to walk again. My legs just weren't strong enough and I collapsed and tried to crawl but didn't work. For some reason I was in my old old school building.</p>

				<h3>13 April 2014</h3>
				<p>Marathon? or festival with tents and mud and wellies and shorts. Lots of bright green pens stuck in the ground around the fence or near the path with a few odd brown pens. Old friends from the area I grew up (Silke, Bernd, Marijke) swimming pool. River I jumped in. Storm. Walking along a motorway to a supermarket. Looking for shorts/short leggings to buy (asda quality awesomeness for ￡3). Buying beer for Migi who was waiting in the staircase and who I met randomly. Alena was there trying on clothes with me. Hills. A stage with incredibly weird mini-short-displays of weird stage deco and a projection of sorts. Supposedly meant to be arty but looked like a cheap kindergarten production. Tomoyuki was there and we talked about research and work. Silke kept interrupting me talking about her elusive dad.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>06 April 2014</h3>
				<p>I walked into the classroom at school. (My old school before Karlsruhe) I sat down on my seat and then realised that I was sitting on my neighbours seat. So I got up and looked around and my chair was some place else. Later on in the next break I approached her (the girl in whose chair I sat first) and said "Sorry I sat in your chair. In the universe I come from, I used to sit right next to you here and we were friends. But in this universe it seems I'm sitting over there".</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>?? April 2014</h3>
				<p>Me and three girlfriends (2 from my old school and 1 from the one in Karlsruhe - all of them not actually friends of mine, just some girls I knew from then) were on a strange sort of Indiana Jones type trip somewhere with only one kinda path ahead and lots and lots of traps. The kind of thing Indy would encounter right before finding the treasure. No idea what we were doing. It felt like we didn't want to be there, so I don't think we were treasure hunting. More like somebody had dropped us into this nightmare for no reason. I was struggling a lot all the time. Not keeping up, not being flexible enough, not strong enough... Two of the other girls had bugs in their ears. They sort of tried to help me along but it was hard and I knew they would leave me behind if necessary.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>13 March 2014</h3>
				<p>It included my first love and some sort of disaster, running around trying to find survivors, we were sort of trapped in a building. He was just there watching me like he used to.</p>

			<li>
				<h3>28 February 2014</h3>
				<p>There was hair! Something about hair. Maybe I cut mine? But it was curly? Not sure. The other odd bit was that I was kissing one of my school mates (Mulski) a lot.</p>
